# 🛩 My First Data Science Adventure by Derek Karungani

## About Me

Hello! My name is Derek Karungani, and I'm thrilled to begin my tech journey.
I'm eager to take on challenges and explore the endless possibilities coding offers.
This is an exciting chapter and I can't wait to see where the journey takes me.

## 🧐 About This Project

The goal is to create a README file that showcases skills in Markdown and GitHub.
It's not just a file, it's a statement: *"I'm ready to forge a tech path!"*  

## 🛠 Getting Started

Here's how I created this first README file:

1. Opened **VS Code** and created a file called 'README.md'.

2. Learned some basic Markdown formatting such as * for headings.

3. Wrote down what excites me about this journey!

4. Uploaded it to **Github** (my first-ever push 🎇)

## Features

📝 Learning Markdown basics.
✨ First experience with Github.
🎉 Taking the first step in data and computer science.

## 🎁 Thank You

A big thank you to **MIT Emerging Talent** for kickstarting this incredible journey!

## Note

And to *future me*, let this README be a reminder of how far you have come!
